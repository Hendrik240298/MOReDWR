# MORe_DWR
## Structure
We have Heat and Elastodynamics Code. Each has its own folder. Fruther each of this folders has a *ROM*, *FOM*, and *Data* folder which content is self-explanatory by their names. Note that in the Heat case each of these three folders has data or code for *1D* and *2D* scenarios. For information on each of this cases look in their case-specific readme.
